This is the application where users can choose a train route based on country, departure, arrival cities and date.
Hope you will find it worth your attention.

The application is built on the assumption that there are only two classes of seats: regular and business class. 
And also that all wagons are the same.

NOTE: 'bc' in code means 'business class'
